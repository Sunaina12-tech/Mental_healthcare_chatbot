# Mental_healthcare_chatbot

This project involves the development of MetalCare, a student-built healthcare chatbot designed to offer preliminary medical guidance through both text and voice interactions. MetalCare is implemented in Python and combines three main components: the OpenAI GPT-4 model for natural language understanding and generation, the Pandas library for structured management of medical and patient data, and the SpeechRecognition module for seamless voice input. The goal of MetalCare is to create an accessible, user-friendly tool that can help people check symptoms, retrieve drug information, and receive basic healthcare advice without immediately needing to consult a medical professional.

MetalCare’s architecture is divided into four stages. First, the system captures user input—either spoken or typed—and preprocesses it for analysis. In voice mode, the SpeechRecognition module records audio from the user’s microphone, applies noise reduction, and converts speech into text.
