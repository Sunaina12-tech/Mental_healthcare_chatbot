# Mental_healthcare_chatbot

This project involves the development of MetalCare, a student-built healthcare chatbot designed to offer preliminary medical guidance through both text and voice interactions. MetalCare is implemented in Python and combines three main components: the OpenAI GPT-4 model for natural language understanding and generation, the Pandas library for structured management of medical and patient data, and the SpeechRecognition module for seamless voice input. The goal of MetalCare is to create an accessible, user-friendly tool that can help people check symptoms, retrieve drug information, and receive basic healthcare advice without immediately needing to consult a medical professional.

MetalCare’s architecture is divided into four stages. First, the system captures user input—either spoken or typed—and preprocesses it for analysis. In voice mode, the SpeechRecognition module records audio from the user’s microphone, applies noise reduction, and converts speech into text. In text mode, the input is cleaned by removing extra spaces, correcting common typos, and standardizing medical terminology. Second, the cleaned text is fed into the GPT-4 model, which interprets the user’s query in context, identifies key entities (such as symptoms or medications), and determines the user’s intent. Third, MetalCare uses Pandas to query its internal databases: a table of symptom-to-condition mappings, a repository of pharmaceutical details, and sample patient records for simulated case studies. Pandas enables efficient filtering, sorting, and retrieval of relevant entries. 
Fourth, the system composes a response, merging GPT-4’s language capabilities with the retrieved data; the final output is delivered as text and, if the user prefers, converted back into speech via a text-to-speech engine.
